## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We're a small open source community. We make things that make us happy or work for the workflows we prefer in our day to day. Many are used in real workplaces, many are just for fun. The community is the important bit to us and we're slowly supporting other maintainers that feel the same.

Got an idea you want to build, but don't have all the devops nonsense figured out? Well, if you're ok with kubernetes for services or standard tooling for libraries and stuff, we'll help CI/CD you up and collaborate with you on your project.

We primarily talk on Discord, not Github. Find that here: https://discord.gg/sfNb9xRjPn

If you want to contribute to one of our projects, reach out there BEFORE you code. We're picky about our workflows and our solutions, because they are our happy place. We'd like to keep them that way and we'll happily let you join us if you will follow our ways.

May your programming be fun again.
